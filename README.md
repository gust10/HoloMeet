# HoloMeet
### An Online Meeting Web App with Real-Time Hand Interactions

---

## 🌟 Introduction
In a world where remote work has become the norm, people are searching for more immersive and interactive ways to communicate online. **HoloMeet** is a web application designed for professionals, educators, and remote teams who crave a richer online meeting experience. By leveraging real-time hand tracking with Mediapipe, HoloMeet introduces a new dimension to virtual meetings, allowing users to interact in ways that traditional video calls simply can't match.

## 🎯 Development Goals
Over the past few years, the demand for online meeting solutions has skyrocketed as remote work becomes increasingly prevalent. While Meta introduced a virtual 3D environment for meetings, it was only accessible through MetaQuest. HoloMeet bridges this gap by offering a more accessible, interactive solution. By utilizing Mediapipe's real-time hand tracking, HoloMeet enhances user interaction, creating a more engaging online meeting environment.
